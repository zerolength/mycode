    template:
      src: templates/missions.txt.j2     # name of the template on ansible controller
      dest: "~/{{ item.mission }}-mission-orders.txt"  # each time through the loop, we want a file named uniquely
    vars:
      planet: "{{ item.planet }}"
    loop:   # each time through the loop, each dict (list entry) will be an "item"
    - {"mission": "primary", "planet": "luna park"}
    - {"mission": "secondary", "planet": "cineplex 14"}  ## This is the list we want to loop across
